# This file contains messages and other texts displayed in the
# AutoCVS plugin user interface.

# Generic message displayed when a CVS update fails.
failed.update.generic=The attempt to automatically run CVS update on a project failed. \
	It is possible that your computer is not connected to a network, or that \
	the CVS server is not available.

# Message displayed when an update fails because a file is in the
# way (i.e., added in the repository and independently created in the
# local workspace).
failed.update.fileintheway=A new file in the CVS repository cannot be checked \
	out because there is a local file with the same name.  You need to delete the \
	local file that is in the way and restart Eclipse.

# Message displayed when a CVS commit fails because the modified file
# or files are not up to date.
failed.commit.notuptodate=An automatic CVS commit failed because one or more \
	modified files were not up to date.  This probably means that you made changes \
	to the project using another computer.  You need to do a manual CVS update \
	on the project before proceeding.

# Message displayed when files are found to have a merge conflict.
failed.commit.mergeconflict=One or more files have a merge conflict. \
	This most likely means that files in the CVS repository were modified from outside of \
	this workspace.  You will need to manually edit the affected files to remove \
	the conflict(s), and then run a manual CVS commit to bring the repository \
	up to date with your workspace.

# Generic message explaining that because of an error, automatic CVS
# command support is disabled for the duration of the session.
error.offline=Because of one or more failed CVS operations, support for automatic \
	CVS commands is disabled for the duration of this session.  Any changes you \
	make to your workspace will not be automatically committed to the repository. \
    You can still perform manual CVS operations and submit your project.
